# wbdv-f20-ngalinski-client-a9

copied from this repo: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/ngalinski/wbdv-f20-ngalinski-client-angular

switched to non-NEU github to try to deploy to heroku, but ran into other problems. 

this repo began as a direct copy from above repo as a project on local machine. previous commits can
 be seen in other repo, but most changes were not committed at time of change due to being on local machine.
